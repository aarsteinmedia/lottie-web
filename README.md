# AM Lottie-Web
Work in progress: This is a modified version of Airbnb's [lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web), made to adress issues with Server Side Rendering in Node, tree shaking and other minor bugs.

This package is primarily made to work with `@aarsteinmedia/dotlottie-player` and `@aarsteinmedia/dotlottie-player-light`. Any use cases outside of that are incidental and due to inherited features of `airbnb/lottie-web`.
